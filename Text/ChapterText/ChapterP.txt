## LivvyAccept
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidRight][3L]I was just wondering if you'd join me[N]

and all the others, of course![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aww, [HalfCloseEyes]you know I'd join you anywhere![....][N]

kinda tired of patrols, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][BenBoop]Great![....] That's really great.[....][N]
[ToggleSmile]And hey, stick close to me[N]
once the fighting starts, yeah?[A][CSS]

## ZoTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZo][OpenMidRight][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidLeft][LoadZoSad][ZoBoop][CloseEyes]Honestly, you'd think this place[N]
could afford to invest in proper security[...A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBenSad][BenBoop][ToggleSmile][1L]I think that's what we're here for, Zo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][LoadZo][ZoBoop][1L]I meant in long-term.[A][CSS]
[2L]We're mercenaries,[N]
not a dedicated militia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][BenBoop][1L]Most of those types snuffed it in the war.[A][CSS][2L]Emperor what's-his-face enlisted any[N]
bum who could hold a pitch fork.[AN]
It's understandable why they'd be[N]
short staffed of late.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][1L][LoadZoSad][ZoBoop][CloseEyes]I know, I know.[A][CSS][OpenEyes]Still[...A][CSS][2L][LoadZo][ZoBoop]It makes me worry what the guy's gonna do[N]
once we've completed our job.[AN]
Even if we repel some pirate crew now,[N]
another is bound to show up later.[A]
[OpenMidRight][3L][CloseEyes]I think if the issue drags on for that[N]
long, it'd probably fall into Tia's hands.[....][N]
[OpenEyes]I'm honestly surprised it hasn't already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][1L][CloseEyes]Yeah[...A][CSS][OpenEyes]We might have to report to her after this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile][2L]Not a bad plan.[....] [OpenEyes]I think we were[N]
about due for a visit soon anyway![A][X]

you join me on the frontlines?[A][CSS]
